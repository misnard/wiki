# Material Design Template for DokuWiki

This Material template is very easy to install and use, whilst offering a multitude of customization options.

You can begin by choosing between several color themes in the style.ini file. From there on, you can fully customize the sidebar, making use of the entire material icon pack.

Visit the template page on the [DokuWiki forums](https://www.dokuwiki.org/template:material)

It is based off [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/) with some minor changes and adjustements.

Alternatively, you can choose your own, for example from [the Material Icons page](https://material.io/icons/).

The toolbar can then looking like the following:
